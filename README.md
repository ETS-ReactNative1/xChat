# xChat
## About the project
This is my first project. The objective is to learn React Native in app development. This app envolves an API made by me with authentication protocols, multiple users handling, and much more...
## What did I learned so far with this project:
- Structuring a project
- How do components work (Both class and functional)
- How to use contexts
- How to work with images and media
- How do android permissions work
- How to use GitHub and Git (In depth)
- And much more...

## App objective
This application was created because the Connected2me community was tired of the little support from technical support, senseless and random sanctions and many more problems, actually, the creator of this app was a user of this application for about 2 years ...
xChat was created for shy people who prefer to be anonymous until they gain confidence, and who prefer to introduce themselves later. Text, image and video stories, messages, customizing the app, and the desire for many more functions are what have led me to make this application.
I have developed an algorithm that allows the community to self-regulate through votes whose weight is based on a confidence factor that in turn depends on the user's statistics. In this way, the vote of a totally new user has much less weight, or none at all, than that of a user with 2 years old active and with 20,000 messages sent, among many other factors. 
Therefore, trust factor also depends on whether you report correctly and not to people who have done nothing wrong. Lowering your trust factor below a certain amount can lead to a penalty warn, which can lead to the total and marked blocking of your account, with the possibility of appealing the block up to 1 month after it happens.
